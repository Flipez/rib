Tonight's the night.
Look! Or I will cut your eyelids right off your face.
Harry and Dorris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me. But they're both dead now. I didn't kill them, honest.
Harry was a great cop here in Miami. He taught me how to think like one; he taught me how to cover my tracks. I'm a very neat monster.
People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well. That's my burden, I guess.
I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted, until the dark became my world and I could see.
Doakes thinks he knows my secrets. But he only needs to look at this - my body of work - to know the real me.
How many more bodies would there have been had I not gotten to those killers? I didn't want to save lives, but save lives I did. Motivation aside, I think Harry and Lundy would agree on this one.
I will not kill my sister.
Nah... Miami's too hot for all that leather.
Lets just say i'm not exactly the boy next door.
There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths, that lie beneath the surface.
I really need to kill somebody.
People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.
In the land of predators, a lion never fears the jackal.
It's strange to have a creation out there, a deeply mutated version of yourself running loose and screwing everything up. I wonder if this is how parents feel?
