Dexter says | Tonight's the night.
Dexter says | Look! Or I will cut your eyelids right off your face.
Dexter says | Harry and Dorris Morgan did a wonderful job raising me. But they're both dead now. I didn't kill them, honest.
Dexter says | Harry was a great cop here in Miami. He taught me how to think like one; he taught me how to cover my tracks. I'm a very neat monster.
Dexter says | People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well. That's my burden, I guess.
Dexter says | I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted, until the dark became my world and I could see.
Dexter says | Doakes thinks he knows my secrets. But he only needs to look at this - my body of work - to know the real me.
Dexter says | How many more bodies would there have been had I not gotten to those killers? I didn't want to save lives, but save lives I did. Motivation aside, I think Harry and Lundy would agree on this one.
Dexter says | I will not kill my sister.
Dexter says | Nah... Miami's too hot for all that leather.
Dexter says | Lets just say i'm not exactly the boy next door.
Dexter says | There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths, that lie beneath the surface.
Dexter says | I really need to kill somebody.
Dexter says | People fake a lot of human interactions, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well.
Dexter says | In the land of predators, a lion never fears the jackal.
Dexter says | It's strange to have a creation out there, a deeply mutated version of yourself running loose and screwing everything up. I wonder if this is how parents feel?
